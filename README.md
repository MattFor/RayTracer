# RayTracer

This is a simple raytracer created by MattFor, inspired by the guide [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

## Getting Started

To generate an output image, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory in PowerShell.
2. Use the following command:

    ```
    .\cmake-build-debug\RayTracer.exe | Out-File -FilePath "../image_result.ppm" -Encoding ASCII
    ```

3. Open the resulting file (`image_result.ppm`) using an image viewer such as XnView.

## More to come
I'll be working with the other RayTracing in a ... guides to make this program better!
